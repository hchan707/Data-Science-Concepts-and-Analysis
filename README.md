## 👶 Project: Birth Rate and Educational Attainment Analysis

**Goal:**  
To investigate how maternal education levels and Medicaid coverage influence U.S. birth rates across states from 2010 to 2023.

**Method:**  
- Multiple linear regression
- Correlation analysis
- Residual diagnostics
- Design matrix formulation

**Key Findings:**  
- Maternal **college education** had the strongest positive relationship with birth rate (R² = 0.64; overall model R² = 0.82).
- Births among mothers without high school education and those on Medicaid also showed positive associations but with weaker explanatory power.
- The project demonstrates how social and educational factors jointly explain over 80% of variation in state-level birth rates.
